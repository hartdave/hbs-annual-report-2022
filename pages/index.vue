        <h1>The Year in Review</h1>
        <p class="snap">
          After a tumultuous two years of figuring out how to adapt and thrive
          in the face of COVID-19, fiscal year 2022 brought a steady return to
          normalcy at Harvard Business School. It seemed like two different
          years wrapped into one, beginning with an intense effort around
          welcoming the entire community back and culminating in a joyous
          crescendo of multiple commencements and alumni reunions--with more
          than 23,000 in attendance, including graduates, friends, and family
          members. Throughout it all, HBS faculty, students, and staff displayed
          the resilience, flexibility, and innovative spirit that have become
          our hallmark in these challenging times.

          Twenty-three faculty members, including new tenure-track professors,
          visitors, and practitioners, participated in START, a deep-dive
          orientation to the School that took place virtually over three days in
          July 2021 with one day on campus in August. The program provides an
          overview of Harvard Business School and a window into research and
          research support at the School, the case method, and the classroom
          experience. Teaching faculty join study groups and practice preparing
          and opening a case, and then receive feedback and advice from
          experienced colleagues.

          <p>
            After a two-year hiatus because of COVID-19, the first-year required
            Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development (FIELD)
            course returned. Given the unpredictability of pandemic travel
            restrictions, the program pivoted to focus on U.S. challenges and
            opportunities, taking more than 1,000 students to one of 15 domestic
            locations. With a lens on the course’s three modules-- contextual
            intelligence, team effectiveness, and design thinking—teams took on
            challenges in cities such as Tulsa, OK and Columbus, OH. Smaller
            group sizes allowed for faster implementation of change and gave
            students transferrable concepts and skills to leverage throughout
            their careers.

            Synergies Across Executive Education &amp; HBS Online
          </h2>
          <p>
            HBS Online and Executive Education were combined under one
            management structure to reflect and respond to emerging trends
            toward programs that utilize both in-person and online components,
            and will further amplify HBS’s efforts in professional
            development. Patrick Mullane, previously at the helm of HBS Online,
            took on the newly designed role of Executive Director of Executive
            Education and HBS Online, joining Professor Luis Viceira, who serves
            as Senior Associate Dean for these groups as well. This new
            organizational structure will allow the School to expand and
            leverage opportunities across the constituencies and learners they
            serve while further strengthening their individual positions and
            managing their growth and long-term success. FY22 was marked by a
            return to in-person learning. For Executive Education this meant
            welcoming over 10,000 participants to campus in Comprehensive
            Leadership, Focused, Global and Custom programs. And, while the HBS
            Online portfolio continued its rapid growth with four new
            certificate programs and three new Certificates of Specialization,
            it also hosted Connext, an annual gathering of learners, in a hybrid
            format with over 1,500 attendees, as well as a campus-based reunion
            for the Harvard Business Analytics Program’s 400 participants who
            had attended virtual immersions in 2020 and 2021.

          <p>
            The 2021-22 academic year marked the centennial of the introduction
            of the case method at Harvard Business School. The very first case,
            General Shoe Company, was published in 1921, at a time when the
            field of management education was still quite new. Dean Wallace
            Donham strongly believed that the best way to teach business
            education was by discussion, not by lecture. His visionary approach
            had an impact on hundreds of other business schools, thousands of
            companies, and millions of managers around the world. The case
            method teaches students how to learn: to practice drilling down to
            the root cause of issues, asking questions, and listening to others’
            viewpoints. A

            The year 1922 was pivotal at HBS not only for the establishment of
            the School’s signature teaching methodology, but also for the
            creation of Harvard Business Publishing’s flagship publication,
            Harvard Business Review (HBR). For the past century, HBR has been
            required reading in executive suites around the world and a
            sought-after platform for business scholars and thought leaders. In
            2022, HBR highlighted its favorite articles and published a new
            book, HBR at 100: The Most Influential and Innovative Articles from
            Harvard Business Review’s First Century.

            <h3>Making the MBA Program More Affordable</h3>
            <p>
              Over the past several years, the School has taken measures to make
              the MBA Program more affordable to students from different
              socio-economic backgrounds. Last year, that involved implementing
              a new approach to evaluating and awarding need-based scholarships.
              In addition to individual income and assets, a student’s
              socioeconomic background—including their family’s income and
              assets—will also be considered in determining aid. This change
              will help better account for intergenerational wealth differences
              and help remove a barrier for outstanding candidates from lower
              socioeconomic backgrounds, working toward the School’s goal of
              strengthening diversity at HBS.
