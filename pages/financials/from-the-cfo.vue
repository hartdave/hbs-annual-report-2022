          <p>
            After a year and a half of disruption caused by the global pandemic,
            fiscal 2022 was a year of renewal and growth for Harvard Business
            School. We set a bold intellectual agenda, delivered on ambitious
            goals to strengthen the community, and charted an aspirational
            course for the future, demonstrating the resilience of the School’s
            faculty, staff, and students and the strength of the HBS economic
            model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Total revenues increased to a record level in fiscal 2022, exceeding
            our forecast and outpacing the growth in expenses. As a result, our
            net operating surplus more than doubled, enabling us to invest in
            the School’s emerging strategic priorities while maintaining a
            healthy unrestricted reserves balance to spur new initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In view of the School’s accomplishments this past year, it’s fair to
            say that the pandemic has taught us important lessons. Financially
            and operationally, the pandemic strengthened HBS as an institution.
            We developed and integrated new technology into the classroom,
            expanded our research initiatives, and created new muscles in the
            area of virtual and blended teaching and learning.
          </p>

          <h2>The HBS Economic Model</h2>
          <p>
            What distinguishes the HBS economic model is a commitment to
            research that is largely internally funded. At the heart of this
            research is the School’s faculty, scholars who are passionate about
            advancing knowledge, shaping the practice of management, and
            inspiring passion in their students. Our faculty members stay close
            to practice, interacting in the field with leaders and managers who
            are confronting the day’s most pressing business challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            They apply knowledge gained in the field to generate intellectual
            capital, including case studies, books, articles, and online content
            to educate leaders and influence the managers on a global scale.
            Completing the self-sustaining cycle, income earned through key
            revenue streams—Executive Education, Harvard Business Publishing
            (HBP), and Harvard Business School Online—supplements revenues from
            MBA tuition and alumni gifts as key sources of funding for faculty
            research. These programs help provide the financial resources that
            enable the School to deliver on its mission of educating leaders who
            make a difference in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the history of HBS, we have aspired to serve as a living model
            of a well-run organization, one that applies the skills, tools, and
            frameworks taught across the School’s programs. Transparency is a
            cornerstone of this goal. Toward this end, I invite you to review
            our financial results in detail in the Supplemental Financial
            Information section of this Annual Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            The balance of this letter discusses our fiscal 2022 results in the
            context of our economic model, concluding with the financial
            forecast for fiscal 2023 and some thoughts on the longer-term
            strategic outlook.
          </p>

          <h2>Fiscal 2022 Review</h2>
          <p>
            Total revenues grew 20 percent year over year to a record $966
            million, driven primarily by Executive Education, HBP, and MBA
            tuition and fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a challenging fiscal 2021 in which Executive Education was
            forced to halt operations and then rapidly transition to all-virtual
            programing because of the pandemic, the group returned to largely on
            campus programming in fiscal 2022. Revenues increased 115 percent
            year over year to $174 million, exceeding our forecast. Equally
            significant was the group’s ability to integrate the knowledge
            gained during the pandemic, complementing 116 residential programs
            with 52 fully virtual programs. The rebound in Executive Education
            revenue is even more impressive considering that the group’s
            on-campus programming was paused for a significant portion of the
            winter to prevent an increase in COVID-19 cases associated with the
            Omicron variant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning to HBP, revenues increased to $302 million, the highest in
            the group’s 28-year history and more than 10 percent higher than the
            prior year. The group leaned into its mission to improve the
            practice of management and its impact in a changing world,
            introducing new content, products, and capabilities. Circulation for
            Harvard Business Review, the group’s flagship publication, grew to a
            record 352,000 readers in fiscal 2022, reflecting the strong demand
            for high-quality digital and print content that gives managers and
            executives the tools to enhance both personal and organizational
            competitiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            HBS Online revenues declined $2 million to $74 million in fiscal
            2022 from $76 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher
            customer acquisition costs amid increased competition in the
            educational technology market. Total enrollment grew to 40,667
            participants, 5 percent higher than the prior year. Although down
            slightly on a year-over-year basis, HBS Online’s fiscal 2022 revenue
            was 72 percent higher than that of fiscal 2019, the most recent
            pre-COVID year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The School’s annual endowment distribution for FY22 increased 4
            percent to $191 million, or 20 percent of total revenues. The
            increase reflected the University’s distribution rate and the size
            of the endowment, which includes gifts from alumni and transfers
            from the School to the endowment reserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The HBS alumni community gave generously in fiscal 2022, with a
            combined $69 million in restricted and unrestricted current use
            giving, or 46 percent of total cash received from gifts.
            Unrestricted giving was particularly robust this past year, $45
            million, 10 percent higher than fiscal 2021. These gifts represent
            the philanthropic cornerstone on which the School pursues new
            opportunities and advances the faculty’s pedagogical and research
            agenda. During the year, HBS welcomed back to campus more than
            14,000 alumni for MBA and Executive Education reunions that had been
            postponed because of the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            MBA tuition and fees increased $24 million, or 21 percent for the
            fiscal year, to $137 million. The increase resulted primarily from
            the arrival of students who had elected the deferral and leave
            options implemented in fiscal 2021 in response to the pandemic.
            Total enrollment in the MBA increased to 1,870 students from 1,609
            students in the prior year. Fiscal 2022 marked the return of the
            Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development (FIELD)
            course after a two-year absence. In addition, the MBA program
            graduated the first class of students from the MS/MBA Biotechnology:
            Life Sciences Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The School invested $43 million on capital spending in fiscal 2022,
            up from $22 million in the prior year. Campus renewal initiatives
            included the renovations of Cash House and Cumnock Hall, the
            addition and fit-out of new leased co-working office space at 114
            Western Avenue, as well as smaller projects. To ensure that the HBS
            campus meets the needs of students, faculty, staff, and alumni over
            the next decade, the School launched a campus framework planning
            process. Designed to align future capital needs with the mission of
            HBS, the process will inform strategic planning for the faculty
            ecosystem, academic programs, residential campus, and digital
            transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to campus renewal and maintenance, this past year we
            continued to invest steadily in Information Technology, which
            remains integral to the School’s growth. IT operating spending
            increased 9 percent in fiscal 2022 to $98 million, accounting for 11
            percent of total operating expenses. New investments included the
            build-out of additional hybrid classrooms and conference rooms.
            These and other infrastructure investments support the School’s
            adaptive approaches to teaching, learning, and working and prepare
            HBS for the evolving future of the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the exponential growth of digitalization across the globe, the
            need for a seamless digital infrastructure at HBS has never been
            more clear. In that regard, a growing part of future budgets will
            involve digital transformation. Launched as a strategic priority by
            Dean Srikant Datar in fiscal 2022, digital transformation centers on
            exploring new ways to use data and information technology to extend
            the reach of the School’s research and teaching endeavors and to
            facilitate deeper connections throughout the HBS community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dean Datar also launched two new Institutes: the Digital, Data, and
            Design Institute at Harvard (D^3) and the Institute for Study of
            Business in Global Society (BiGS). The purpose of D^3 is to study
            how technological changes such as machine learning, digitalization,
            and artificial intelligence are affecting business and society. The
            goal of BiGS is to help harness business to address society’s
            greatest challenges, such as economic inequality, environmental
            destruction and racial injustice. In both areas, the faculty is
            creating foundational and applied research that is brought back to
            the classroom to guide students in their understanding of companies
            and other types of organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Against this revenue and capital investment backdrop, we maintained
            our posture of prudent expense management and financial discipline
            in fiscal 2022. Operating expenses grew 17 percent to $908 million,
            to support the School’s higher revenues and the increased level of
            activity on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in any given year our largest expense—people— is always the
            same, the budget dynamics from one year to the next can be markedly
            different. In fiscal 2021, with the uncertainty around the scope and
            economic impact of the pandemic, the primary objective was to avoid
            layoffs and furloughs. The School scaled back on myriad expenses,
            curbed overtime, and froze pay rates for faculty and exempt staff.
            As a result, salaries and benefits increased just 3 percent from
            FY20 to FY21. In fiscal 2022, with the world having returned to a
            greater semblance of normalcy, the emphasis shifted to ensuring a
            smooth re-entry for students back to campus, and attracting and
            retaining our faculty and staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Salaries and benefits totaled $428 million, or 47 percent of total
            operating expenses, up 11 percent from the prior year. The
            difference reflects an increase in full-time equivalent (FTE)
            faculty and staff coupled with performance-related rate increases
            and the growth in Executive Education payments. Consistent with the
            School’s effort to grow the faculty, and by extension broaden its
            research base, faculty FTEs grew to 272 this past year, 6 percent
            higher than fiscal 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            Increased enrollment in fiscal 2022 drove a 14 percent increase in
            space and occupancy expenses, which rose to $73 million from $64
            million in the prior year. As a percentage of total operating
            expenses, space and occupancy was flat at 8 percent versus fiscal
            2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buoyed by the increase in revenue, the School’s operating surplus
            increased 123 percent to $58 million.
          </p>

          <h2>Fiscal 2023 Outlook</h2>
          <p>
            As I begin my 20th year as chief financial officer of HBS, I have
            never been more excited about the opportunities we have to
            fundamentally influence the future of business leadership at a
            global level through our renewed academic programs, digital
            transformation, and new Institutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have prioritized our commitment to diversity, equity, and
            inclusion (DEI) initiatives across HBS as we continue to develop the
            infrastructure of the School’s recently formed Office of Diversity,
            Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) and develop a School-wide DEI
            strategy.  One of the initial priorities includes increasing our
            supplier diversity through the expansion of our partnerships with
            Black- and minority-owned services providers. We look to further our
            DEI progress through community engagement, learning and development
            opportunities, and recruitment and retention plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fiscal 2023 will be a year of significant investment in the new
            digital transformation effort, as the School begins to develop a
            holistic approach to collecting and managing data across the HBS
            enterprise. Over time, capital will be invested in talent and tools
            to advance the transformation. Plans include launching Centers of
            Excellence to cultivate expertise in areas such as digital marketing
            and social outreach, and community and lifelong learning, as well as
            creating a digital incubator to provide resources for the
            exploration of new ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that as background, let me provide a brief look at our
            near-term financial expectations. On the top line, we are
            forecasting total revenue growth of 9 percent year over year in
            fiscal 2023. Combined revenue from HBP, Executive Education, and HBS
            Online are expected to grow about 10 percent from the prior year, as
            these groups continue to focus on leveraging new technologies and
            platforms to expand their reach. With enrollment increasing to
            approximately 2,000 students in fiscal 2023, MBA tuition and fees
            are expected to grow about 12 percent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ongoing support of HBS alumni will remain vital in fiscal 2023
            and beyond. Restricted and unrestricted current use gifts are
            critical to the School’s ability to propel innovative strategic
            priorities, ensure we can provide need-based financial aid to
            talented students, and support the faculty’s innovative research.

            The HBS endowment distribution is budgeted to increase 9 percent in
            fiscal 2023, which represents the Corporation’s 4.5% approved
            increase, plus distributions on new gifts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at expenses, our fiscal 2023 operating plan assumes an
            increase of approximately 11 percent in total operating expenses,
            about 46 percent of which relates to compensation for faculty and
            administrative staff. Factoring in salary increases, benefit costs,
            and anticipated vacancies, total compensation expense is expected to
            increase from fiscal 2022. Collectively, the School’s other line
            items are expected to increase 12 percent, primarily related to
            investments to grow Executive Education, HBP, and HBS Online.
          </p>

            The School’s capital budget for fiscal 2023 is $39 million, 9
            percent less than the $43 million invested in fiscal 2022. In
            addition to ongoing work at 114 Western Avenue and Cumnock Hall,
            this budget includes investments to complete the campus framework
            plan, create start-up space for D^3 in Cotting House, and upgrade
            several Executive Education hybrid classrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, we begin fiscal 2023 positioned to deliver on the HBS
            mission by continuing to provide robust support for innovative
            teaching and research. Across the School’s core programs and
            activities, the resilience and growth we demonstrated this year
            underlines the value of our contribution to a connected world. As
            always, we remain committed to being good stewards of the School’s
            resources.
