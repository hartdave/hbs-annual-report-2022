          <p>
            In fiscal 2021, Harvard Business School navigated the operational
            and financial challenges of the global pandemic by staying true to
            its guiding principles: The School prioritized the health and
            well-being of its faculty, staff, and students as it leaned into its
            mission of educating leaders who make a difference in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Faced with the most significant disruption to the MBA Program since
            World War II, the School's leadership—including outgoing Dean Nitin
            Nohria and incoming Dean Srikant M. Datar—implemented a clear
            strategy: Maintain the quality of the educational experience by
            investing in hybrid and virtual classroom technologies; protect jobs
            by reducing noncritical expenses and holding salaries level; and lay
            the groundwork for important initiatives in a new, post-COVID world.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the outset of the fiscal year, the School confronted two major
            financial hurdles. First, roughly 20 percent of admitted MBA
            students accepted the School's offer to defer their admission, and
            another 15 percent of existing students took a leave of absence,
            which meant the loss of tens of millions of dollars in tuition
            revenue for fiscal 2021. Second, the pandemic forced Executive
            Education to pivot from its entirely in-person learning model to an
            all-virtual portfolio. Designing and implementing such a portfolio
            from the ground up takes time. Given the complexity and time
            constraints of the task, the initial revenue projection for virtual
            Executive Education programming in fiscal 2021 was penciled in at
            what seemed like a realistic expectation: $0.
          </p>
          <p>
            But with the entire School community coming together, HBS adapted.
            Driven by better-than-expected results in Harvard Business
            Publishing (HBP) and Harvard Business School Online and the support
            of HBS alumni, the School delivered financial results that came in
            significantly ahead of expectations. In a year when HBS had budgeted
            an operating deficit, the School instead generated an operating
            surplus of $26 million in fiscal 2021.
          </p>
          <h2>The HBS Economic Model</h2>
          <p>
            The resilience of the School's economic model was tested during
            fiscal 2021 and proved sound. The HBS model is unique among Harvard
            University's 12 graduate and professional schools. At its core is a
            commitment to internally funded faculty research. Earned income from
            Executive Education, HBP, and HBS Online, augmented by revenue from
            MBA tuition and alumni gifts, generates a value-sustaining circle of
            funding. These financial resources enable the School to execute on
            its strategic priorities, regardless of the economic environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            HBS research budgets provide the School's faculty the freedom to
            pursue the questions that interest them most and stay close to
            practice, generating insights that can help address the most
            pressing issues confronting businesses, organizations, and society.
            The faculty then bring the learnings from these interactions back
            into the classroom. By informing their teaching in all the School's
            educational programs, their knowledge educates the next generation
            of leaders and influences the practice of management on a global
            scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I write, the world continues to face uncertainty. Container ships
            bottleneck the world's ports; supply chains are unable to keep up
            with demand, and product shortages loom. Inflation is rising. Racial
            injustice and economic inequality persist. Businesses are adapting
            to the new dynamic of a remote workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
            HBS faculty members researched these and other issues in fiscal 2021
            and, despite the pandemic, produced significant output. The School's
            256 full-time equivalent (FTE) faculty produced 668 cases and course
            development materials, as well as 491 books, articles, and working
            papers. Additionally, the School convened nearly 1,400 academics and
            practitioners across 10 research conferences and hosted a widely
            attended virtual faculty research symposium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Innovation across the MBA Program continued in fiscal 2021, as the
            School delivered the first year of the new joint MS/MBA in
            Biotechnology: Life Sciences (a joint degree with the Graduate
            School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School through the
            Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology). With so
            many organizations requiring leaders who possess a broad skillset
            and perspective, this and other joint degree programs provide
            students with invaluable, cross-disciplinary expertise that equips
            them to tackle diverse business challenges. Recognizing their
            importance, HBS covers a portion of the staff and operational
            expenses required to support them, and shares the MBA tuition with
            the partnering Harvard schools. We receive generous support from HBS
            alumni, whose gifts offset the expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Doctoral Program also made the successful transition to remote
            learning, delivering 30 courses virtually. All of the Program's
            graduates were fully employed at graduation, and the School
            developed a financial aid plan to support an additional year for
            those students whose job search was affected by the pandemic.
          </p>

            The balance of my letter reports on our fiscal 2021 financial
            results and our outlook for fiscal 2022. One of our financial goals
            is for HBS to serve as a living example of a well-run organization,
            embodying the skills, tools, and frameworks taught across the
            School's educational programs. Transparency is intrinsic to
            achieving this goal. Toward this end, the
            <nuxt-link to="/financials/supplemental"
              >Supplemental Financial Information</nuxt-link

            section will explore our results in more detail.
          </p>
          <h2>Fiscal 2021 Review</h2>
          <p>
            Total revenue decreased by approximately 7 percent from the prior
            year to $805 million, primarily reflecting lower revenue from MBA
            tuition and Executive Education, partly offset by top-line gains
            from HBP and HBS Online.
          </p>
          <p>
            For HBP, fiscal 2021 revenue increased 5 percent, as the group
            advanced its goal of improving the practice of management and its
            impact in a changing world. In support of that mission, HBP
            developed content on timely and highly relevant issues such as
            advancing racial equity, teaching in hybrid and virtual
            environments, and the impact of the pandemic on the future of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group's flagship publication, Harvard Business Review (HBR),
            continued to generate value from its tiered subscription strategy,
            launched in fiscal 2019. Reflecting the success of HBR's digital
            initiatives and the relevance of its content, the number of average
            monthly visitors to HBR.org has more than doubled over the past five
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, HBP is focused on driving growth across its core
            editorial products, increasing its global scale, and building
            strategic partnerships that enhance the group's capabilities and
            broaden its reach. HBS Online revenue increased approximately 31
            percent in fiscal 2021, significantly exceeding our forecast and
            generating an operating surplus for the third consecutive year.
            Through an expanded range of course offerings, HBS Online reached
            more than 40,000 participants in fiscal 2021. The group has topped
            122,000 participants since it began seven years ago. The group began
            work on the Early College Business Initiative (ECBI), which seeks to
            inspire underrepresented minority college students to pursue
            management careers.

            Although Executive Education revenue was down approximately 45
            percent, fiscal 2021 was a strong year for the group. With all
            residential programs paused as a result of the pandemic, the group
            rapidly shifted gears to provide impactful programming in a virtual
            format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the year, Executive Education designed and
            delivered 70 virtual Comprehensive Leadership and Topic-Focused
            Programs for more than 4,400 participants around the world. Of the
            13,101 individuals who participated in programs in fiscal 2021, 32
            percent were women—a significant increase from past years.
            Reflecting the focus of sustaining an engaged learning environment,
            participants rated the quality of the virtual Executive Education
            experience as high.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, Executive Education plans to retain and enhance the
            best aspects of the virtual, blended, and on-campus experiences to
            drive sustainable growth across the portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The School's annual endowment distribution for FY21 increased
            approximately 6 percent to $184 million, or about 23 percent of
            total revenues. The increase reflected the University's distribution
            rate and the size of the endowment, which includes gifts from alumni
            and transfers from the School to the endowment reserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The endowment consists of more than 1,000 discrete funds established
            over the years by individual donors, corporations, and reunion
            classes. The School budgets the use of endowment distributions to
            support operations based on the intentions of the donors and the
            terms of individual gifts. While the endowment is the School's
            largest financial asset, HBS is among the least dependent on
            endowment income of the University's 12 degree-granting schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Revenue from current use gifts was ahead of forecast at $60 million
            in fiscal 2021, flat with the prior year. Restricted and
            unrestricted current use gifts will continue to play an important
            role in innovation funding for HBS. This income enables the School
            to immediately capitalize on emerging opportunities that advance the
            faculty's pedagogical mission and research agenda.
          </p>
          <p>
            MBA tuition and fees declined $23 million, or approximately 17
            percent for the fiscal year, to $113 million. The change was driven
            primarily by the flexible deferral and leave policy enacted in
            response to COVID-19. Total enrollment in the MBA Program decreased
            to 1,530 students from 1,847 students in the prior year. The
            occupancy rate of HBS dorms—90 to 95 percent in a typical year—was
            only 50 percent in FY21. For the second consecutive year, COVID-19
            also caused the cancellation of the semester-long FIELD Global
            Immersion course, resulting in a refund to students.

          <p>
            As HBS leadership began planning for fiscal 2021, COVID-19 was at
            the front of the decision-making process. Given the ongoing
            uncertainty about the pandemic, all departments scrutinized their
            budgets, preserving only those critical, strategically important
            expenses that were feasible in light of COVID-related restrictions.
            People were the priority. To avoid layoffs or furloughs, the School
            scaled back on a range of expenses, reduced overtime, and kept pay
            rates for faculty and exempt staff flat for the fiscal year.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of these initiatives, combined with the pandemic-related
            decrease in campus activity, total operating expenses for fiscal
            2021 declined approximately 6 percent to $779 million from $831
            million in the prior year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Salaries and benefits, the largest component of operating expenses,
            increased approximately 3 percent to $386 million. With faculty and
            staff pay rates remaining flat in fiscal 2021, the variance
            primarily related to the roughly 5 percent growth in FTE faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space and occupancy expenses declined 10 percent to $64 million,
            reflecting the decrease in student enrollment and on-campus
            activity. What is not immediately evident in this line item is that
            the School invested several million dollars in pay continuation
            benefits, consistent with its long-standing commitment to the
            broader HBS community. These benefits ensured that hundreds of
            contingent and contract workers, including cafeteria staff and
            custodians, would continue to be paid even for periods they were not
            needed on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of note, for fiscal 2021, Harvard University granted a one-time
            waiver of a particular assessment the School pays annually to the
            University. During a period of financial uncertainty, the waiver
            allowed HBS to deploy more of its resources to support students and
            the School community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflecting the decline in revenue, cash from operations—the School's
            operating surplus—declined approximately 13 percent to $26 million
            from $30 million in fiscal 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Capital expenses declined approximately 49 percent to $22 million in
            fiscal 2021 from $43 million in the prior year. At the outset of the
            pandemic, the School made a conscious effort to reduce its capital
            spend for the year, focusing on mission-critical projects. These
            projects included initiating the design and renovation of Cash House
            and the renewal of McArthur Hall, and the build-out of hybrid
            classrooms. Funds allocated to the hybrid classrooms were part of a
            $15 million investment in testing and tracing, diagnostic and
            personal protective equipment, enhancements to HVAC systems,
            signage, and other measures designed to keep the School community
            safe.
          </p>
          <h2>Fiscal 2022 Outlook</h2>
          <p>
            Fiscal 2022 marks the first full year for Dean Srikant M. Datar,
            whose vision and experience have been central to setting our
            strategic course and priorities for the year ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The School's fiscal 2022 budget assumes that total revenues will
            increase approximately 14 percent from the $805 million reported in
            fiscal 2021. Combined revenue from HBP, HBS Online, and Executive
            Education is expected to grow at a faster rate. With enrollment
            returning to approximately 1,800 FTE students in fiscal 2022, the
            budget forecasts MBA tuition and fees will grow in the low 20
            percent range.
          </p>
          <p>
            Restricted and unrestricted current use gifts, which represented
            approximately 7 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2021, remain
            vital to the School's health this coming fiscal year. The ongoing
            support of the HBS community is integral to the School's ability to
            advance its curricula, support the faculty's cutting-edge research,
            and invest in the projects that fuel strategic innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We expect HBS to benefit from a 2 percent growth in the endowment
            distribution for fiscal 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving down the income statement, operating expenses are expected to
            increase approximately 19 percent, due in part to the larger faculty
            and higher program-related expenses, including professional
            services. As a result, the School has budgeted a small operating
            deficit for the fiscal year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The School's capital budget for fiscal 2022 is approximately $32
            million, consisting primarily of building renovations and additional
            upgrades to the hybrid classrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the economic cycle, HBS continues to lean into its
            mission to educate leaders who make a difference in the world. As an
            institution built on participant-centered learning, we believe that
            our investment in people will continue to differentiate—and
            elevate—an HBS education. I want to thank the entire HBS community
            for their dedication and many sacrifices during an exceptionally
            challenging year. The technology through which education is
            delivered will no doubt continue to evolve. But the School's
            resource stewardship, outstanding faculty and staff, engaged
            students, and the sustained support from our alumni, position us for
            the opportunities ahead.
